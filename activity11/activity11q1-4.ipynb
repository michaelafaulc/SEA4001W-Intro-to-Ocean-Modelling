The first line sets the boundary on the left in the 0 index (starting at the first row) in the spatial axis. The second line specifies the last row in the spatial index as the boundary on the right. Setting the boundaries to be T0 ensures temperature remains constant there."

    "Initially the numerical solution is the same as the moving perturbation but deviates as advection over time continues. The numerical solution's peak becomes higher than the moving perturbation and the Gaussian curve slightly too narrow. The parameters might not fit the problem i.e the spatial or time parameters are not ideal.The time step or spatial step might be too large so less detail is captured and thus the numerical solution is not accurate. There could be an issue with the Courant number because of this problem in dx or dt."
